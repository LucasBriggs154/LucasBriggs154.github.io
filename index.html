                            Hello! My name is Lucas Briggs (first name Timothy). Welcome to my website where I describe
                            myself and my experiences for friends, family, potential employers, and any aggressive web
                            scraping algorithms reaping all available edges in the world wide web for my personal data.
                            I'm an experienced young engineer with affinity in both electronics and software
                            development. Through both my co-ops I've spent lots of time designing boards for test
                            platforms and subsequently writing the code to run tests on that platform in Python. Through
                            projects both on co-op and out of co-op I've gained more exposure to Python and various
                            industry-standard libraries within it. One area where I would really like to gain more
                            experience is in embedded and digital design. I think that would complete my "hardware
                            stack" of skills, and fit perfectly in the middle of where I've been focused so far.

                        <p>
                            I've been infatuated with space and technology for as long as I can remember. I want to do
                            what I can to improve the lives of all people on Earth and contribute to the advancement of
                            humanity. However, that is a very vague statement, and so I'm in an active search as to
                            where I can best apply myself to acheive those goals. Having been born into a fortunate and
                            happy life I consider it a responsibility to help others live their best possible lives, and
                            I've not yet done nearly enough to that effect.

                            It brings me a lot of joy to spend time in the corner cases of life; To do things that force
                            me out of an ease of living so as to understand living itself. This picture of myself and my
                            friend Michael Gesuale on a "port-a-ledge" captures one of these moments. In this picture we
                            are about 500 feet in the air waking up at six in the morning to begin the next pitch of a
                            big-wall climb in Zion, Utah known as Prodigal Sun. To this day I consider this experience
                            the best four days of "Type 2 Fun" in my life. The climb was called Prodigal Sun because it
                            was north-facing, so we had no sun exposure for any of those four days. Michael does this
                            kind of stuff a lot more than I do, but neither Michael nor I had done a climb this long
                            before, and we were both being effectively dragged up the wall by his cousin Pete (the "Big
                            Wall Ninja"). What ensued was a singular experience and a series of stories I'll never
                            forget.

                            A little note from the author: I started this website as something I could tack on to my
                            resume, something that I needed to do for some reason because everyone else did. Now that
                            I've finished it (or, at least, the first draft of it) I realize that I really enjoyed
                            journaling and visualizing my experiences in this format. If you do decide to read through
                            all of this content for whatever reason, thank you! I don't consider my life story as one of
                            hardship, triumph, and importance, but I hope that reading about my life gives you some sort
                            of new way to look at your own.

                                            Astranis was an incredible experience for me. Following a first co-op that,
                                            while enjoyable, left me with little in the way of inspiration, my time at
                                            Astranis truly struck me. Some of the team I worked with is pictured to the

                                            Unfortunately I can't show off any pictures of my main project, as that
                                            would
                                            not abide by ITAR restrictions. In this next picture is something that we
                                            called
                                            the "Power Harness Board". It is an extremely simple board that harnesses
                                            between two important power boards for lab-bench flexibility. I managed to
                                            design, build, and order this board in a single day, so perhaps it can help
                                            indicate my proficiency with Altium. If nothing else, it is definitely a
                                            showcase of my silk-art abilities.

                                            My main project arched over the majority of my co-op. It was effectively a
                                            board
                                            that would spoof the payload SDR (the one that does all the magic internet
                                            stuff) so we could test the voltage regulator system with something more
                                            robust
                                            and less expensive than the SDR. We called it the "Load Emulator" as its
                                            main
                                            purpose was to <em>emulate</em> realistic behavior for the <em>load</em> on
                                            each
                                            of the more than 15 different voltage rails that would supply the SDR.

                                            The board I made was good. It worked the first time, only needed a couple
                                            minor
                                            reworks to be fully functional, and got the regulator board through bring-up
                                            on
                                            schedule. However, I think where I really left my mark was with the Python
                                            scripts and Grafana visualizations that I wrote to operate the regulator
                                            board.
                                            Again, I wish I could show those visualizations, but ITAR says no.
                                            Basically, I
                                            was able to build an interactive shell that could perform operations on any
                                            board in the SDR box while gathering telemetry from all of them at once, in
                                            a
                                            background thread. While I was at the company these tools enabled the RTL
                                            team
                                            to burn down issues with their Verilog scripts quickly and effectively.
                                            Since
                                            I've left the company they've helped my team bring the entire SDR box
                                            through
                                            full qualification testing.

                                            I can actually talk about the main circuit on this "Load Emulator" test
                                            platform, as I was able to find a near-replica of it in a TI analog design
                                            article (full article <a
                                                href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa868/slaa868.pdf?ts=1600202605217&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F"
                                                target="_blank">here</a>). We called our version of this an "active
                                            load" circuit, TI calls it a "programmable low side current sink". The point
                                            of this circuit is to have an isolated DAC input set the current drawn on
                                            some supply voltage by varying the voltage over R<sub>SET</sub> (the DAC
                                            output is replicated over R<sub>SET</sub> due to the summing point
                                            constraint of A1). C<sub>F</sub> is a fast-path capacitor that filters out
                                            ringing due to FET gate delay. What's so crucial about this circuit is that
                                            it's a simple design change to optimize it for different maximum current
                                            values. By simply varying the value of R<sub>LOAD</sub>, and adding load
                                            resistors/FETs in parallel, one can easily increase the available current
                                            capacity while staying within de-rating on each component.

                                            There's a real love of interns at Astranis. Partly because they're so cheap,
                                            but
                                            also partly because somehow Astranis is able to push young people to do

                                            incredible work no matter the circumstances. It still blows me away to think

                                            Astranis has some pretty tight restrictions on what I can show because of
                                            ITAR, but Draper is even more hardcore. I don't have any pictures of
                                            anything I worked on, but I do have this picture of me blowing up a sterile
                                            glove at my desk.

                                            Draper was, for me, a very solid first co-op experience. I entered it with
                                            pretty much zero practical knowledge of electrical engineering aside from
                                            what I learned in robotics in high school. In fact, a lot of my intuition
                                            for electronics ended up coming from the fellow co-op on my team, Joshua
                                            Berlin, who was a year ahead of me and very talented at both electrical
                                            engineering and the teaching of it.

                                        <p>
                                            While I was there I learned how to draft a schematic and layout for a simple
                                            board consisting of 7 bi-directional level translators and a custom 8-input
                                            OR-gate (using BJTs). This was my first time going through a full stack
                                            board design process, and I got quite good at the program I was using (but
                                            it was DipTrace, so who really cares). I also had a <em>lot</em> of re-work
                                            to do on this board due to miscommunication between me and my team. Josh saw
                                            me through the process of learning how to actually solder properly so I
                                            could fix the boards as fast as possible.

                                            I also learned a lot about coding and test automation. One project entailed
                                            building a program in Python, Arduino, and GNURadio to operate a servo
                                            platform via both a PyQT GUI and signals coming from 4 different SDRs. These
                                            SDRs were connected to 4 high-directivity antennae arranged in a NSEW
                                            pattern, and the idea was to track an object based on radar signal received
                                            on those antennae. Another project involving Arduino had me design a program
                                            to test the capability of a <a
                                                href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si5338.pdf"
                                                target="_blank">Si5338</a> clock generator chip to sweep it's output
                                            frequency at different accuracies over a large range. This project occured
                                            near the end of my co-op so I then had to write a 17-page guide detailing
                                            how I accomplished this particular sweeping strategy so that the FPGA
                                            engineer on the project would be able to replicate it in HDL.

                                            Draper taught me a lot about how to work effectively on a co-op, and about
                                            what that work meant to me. Management was... distant, and work was
                                            sporadic. So I really had to learn how to go around and ask others for both
                                            stuff to do and help with the stuff I was actively doing. Since then I have
                                            never been shy of asking others to help me when I truly need it, and
                                            consider my self an active and social member of any office. I worked on a
                                            total of 9 different projects, some took up more time than others, but this
                                            was really the ideal way to begin thinking about what application of
                                            electrical engineering I enjoy the most (something I am admittedly still
                                            figuring out). Although, this level of project spread is not something I
                                            would repeat as I often felt spread thin. Draper was also very
                                            "need-to-know" on project impact, so I remain unsure as to whether any of
                                            the work I did could be used on some weapons platform. That idea did and
                                            still does make me uncomfortable, so I've made a point to understand the
                                            full impact and big picture of everything that I work on since then.
                                            Overall, Draper was the right mix of good and not-so-good for me to figure
                                            out what I wanted to do next and set me on a path that I am so far very
                                            happy with.

                                            I wasn't sure whether to include this as Work Experience or Personal
                                            Project, because it's a little bit of both. I worked my way into the RSS
                                            Fingerprinting team of NEU-SPIRAL, a data-oriented research lab an
                                            Northeastern, and started working on a project concerned with indoor
                                            navigation by Wi-Fi received-signal-strength. Luckily there's very little
                                            restriction on what I can show about this project, so get ready for lots of
                                            pictures. What you can see in this first picture is a bunch of Wi-Fi RSS
                                            data collected from a real-world study and displayed as a room using Python
                                            matplotlib. This room was in a library, and the white spaces you can see in
                                            the image are the bookshelves in that room. In total there were 448
                                            different Wi-Fi access points detected over the course of the study, and the
                                            software tools that I wrote allow you to look at the data for any set of
                                            those access points over any collection of epochs within the study.

                                            A key feature of this RSS simulator is the ability to generate a
                                            momentum-influenced random-walk trajectory through the room's valid
                                            positions. This trajectory can be seen in red within the following picture.
                                            There is then the option of "tracking" this trajectory using the available
                                            RSS data and a cubature Kalman filter. The minimized-error trajectory
                                            determined by this tracking algorithm can be seen in blue. Neither the
                                            random walk nor the tracking algorithms were designed directly by me, but I
                                            did have to gain a basic understanding of both in order to implement them
                                            into the simulator.

                                            Another key feature of this tool is the ability to vary the "noise" and
                                            "uncertainty" of the RSS measurements by dragging the "n" and "u" sliders at
                                            the bottom of the plot (the ap slider is to view the RSS data for individual
                                            access points. In this case we are looking at access point 1). In this next
                                            picture you can see noisier RSS data and the resulting noisier trajectory
                                            estimation.

                                            Raising the "uncertainty" slider makes it more likely that an access point
                                            is not detected in a given measurement (based on the probability of that

                                            Oddly enough, the estimation in the more uncertain example is better than
                                            previously when it was just noisy. This is due to the fact that in order to
                                            update each position RSS based on these new uncertainty values we will also
                                            end up reshuffling the noise. This may or may not be an issue, and is an
                                            example of changes I may need to make going forward.

                                            Ah, Spindle. I will never remove this section from my website, no matter how
                                            non-technical it is. It carries too much of my life to not include. The
                                            Spindle Rock Club LLC sailing program was my childhood, my first full-time
                                            summer job, and something that I think deserves the credit of being one of
                                            the most fascinating sailing programs of all time.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I sailed with the program as a student every summer for 4 years. A day from
                                            one of those years is represented in the following photo which, fun fact,
                                            actually made it into the local newspaper. The most intriguing aspect of the
                                            Spindle Rock sailing program is that in the particular location where it is
                                            situated lies a tidal river with a ripping current, and access to the open
                                            ocean less than a mile away. It is honestly a grueling sailing environment
                                            and really teaches you to handle danger in a lot of different situations.
                                            Once I grew up, taking on sailing instructing as a summer job was the
                                            easiest decision I've ever had to make.

                                            I taught for 5 years, the last year of which I was given the job of "Head
                                            Instructor". My performance in that role is actually something I'm quite
                                            proud of. The director of the sailing program also saw a head change. The
                                            new director was an awesome guy by the name of
                                            John Bergland. John and I worked to modernize, restructure, and redefine the
                                            sailing program as something that took the act of instructing more seriously
                                            than in years past. I found that putting in the necessary effort to help a
                                            kid be confident in a sailboat from the get-go was much more rewarding than
                                            being a glorified babysitter. I sort of manifested a curriculum by simply
                                            messing around with different ideas for drills on the water and keeping
                                            what worked. John, myself, and the other instructors worked hard to ensure
                                            that the program could be flexible to the needs of parents. We managed a
                                            dynamic schedule where classes and students could be added on a daily,
                                            sometimes hourly, basis.

                                            The program that year and years following saw great
                                            feedback from parents and students, and there were some numbers to show for
                                            it. Based on figures that I generated for the board of directors that year,
                                            our total revenue and student enrollment both increased about 70% over the
                                            previous year. The instructors I taught with during this time were and are
                                            some of my closest friends. This is one of my favorite pictures I ever took.
                                            It's of my good friend Charles giving a demonstration on proper
                                            dry-capsizing technique, and I believe it encompasses what we were all
                                            about.

                                            I'm proud of what I produced here. This is the first website I have ever
                                            designed. I never took an HTML course in high school, because I incorrectly
                                            thought that I would never need or want webdev as a skill. Soon into this
                                            project I realized that I actually love the process of figuring out how to
                                            design a nice looking webpage. It's almost like an exercise in effectively
                                            conveying information, which is something I routinely ponder. It's also an
                                            opportunity to basically write a journal in which I can reflect on all of my
                                            past experiences in detail. This website is also totally responsive, and
                                            mobile-friendly! It even looks decent on a Galaxy Fold!

                                            In order to accomplish all this I spent a good 6 hours watching Traversy
                                            Media videos on YouTube and reading through various documentation on HTML,
                                            CSS, Flexbox, Grid, and Bootstrap. Actually, oddly enough, I did have some
                                            experience in React Native going in. My roommate and I got about halfway
                                            through designing an app before a company known as Atleto managed to release
                                            something remarkably similar. During that project, however, I spent much
                                            more time with the data transfer than the UI design. That same roommate,
                                            Danny McGrath, got really good at webdev and was a huge help in directing me
                                            to the right resources while I was building this website.

                                            I contracted my roommate John Byrne, who has recently been spending a lot of
                                            time having fun in Photoshop, to craft me a little logo with my initials.
                                            Using circuit components was all his idea, and I think it turned out really
                                            well! To check out his website and other friends' websites, check out the

                                            While I was quarantined in San Francisco due to COVID-19, my roommates and I
                                            participated in a remote hackathon in the form of Hacktech 2020. It was
                                            disappointing not being able to go down to LA and get the full experience,
                                            but we had fun with it nonetheless. The full project can be found <a

                                            The Devpost has way more information than I'm going to provide here, but
                                            I'll reiterate a few things. First of all, we won! Well, we got 3rd place in
                                            the "eBay API" category. But that's still enough to get us the title of
                                            "Winner", and there were quite a few projects in that category since the 1st
                                            place prize was an Apple Watch. Being able to say I won my first hack-a-thon
                                            is pretty sweet. This was also my first full software project that I saw
                                            through from start to finish, and gave me a lot of experience in Python. My
                                            job throughout the project was to build a series of web-scrapers that would
                                            go to online storefronts like Amazon or Wal-Mart and gather data on what
                                            products would show up when you search certain keywords. I would scrape the
                                            page for product names and prices and then compile the data into the top 10
                                            words by frequency-of-use and an average price point. It turned out to be
                                            pretty accurate, and the resulting nonsensical jumble of keywords worked
                                            very well as a product description for eBay's search algorithm.

                                            Altogether this project was a great success, and I'm grateful especially to
                                            my roommate at the time, Nikhil Bhat, who had a lot more Python experience
                                            at the time and helped me a lot when I would get stuck.

                                        <p>I will be the first to admit, this project has given me some trouble. The
                                            idea here is to build a circuit to both process an audio signal and control
                                            a set of programmable RGB LEDs (WS2815). My initial implementation employed
                                            the strategy of using a single-supply op-amp to DC-bias the input audio
                                            signal so that it could be received directly at the ADC of a Teensy
                                            microcontroller. The pdfs of the schematic and layout (made in Eagle) for
                                            this design can be seen below.</p>
                                        <p>The digital circuitry involved here (basically just a microcontroller and a
                                            level translator) worked like a dream, as you can see in this gif. However
                                            the analog circuit was a different story.</p>

                                            In the next picture you can see my initial implementation of this on a
                                            soldered protoboard, which ended up being a mistake. Since my desire to do
                                            this resulted in me having to limit myself to thru-hole components, and a
                                            random solder bridge led to me shorting and frying my Teensy, this ended up
                                            being much more expensive than just ordering the PCB. After taking a break
                                            from this project and coming back, I realized that I've probably been going
                                            about it the wrong way.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Inducing a DC bias on the audio signal makes the complexity of this circuit
                                            much more difficult to implement. Also, after simming the circuit in LTSpice
                                            I found that it introduced some delay to amplitude changes in the output.
                                            This is not ideal for a circuit that needs to respond to changes in an audio
                                            signal as fast as possible.

                                        <p>Going forward I am going to address these problems in the circuit either by
                                            re-implementing the DC biasing circuit or by scrapping it and using an
                                            external high-speed ADC that can detect positive and negative voltages. All
                                            I would need then is a standard input buffer and standard audio ADC. I am
                                            also going to move this design over to KiCAD, as I believe it has become a
                                            superior design tool to Eagle in a lot of ways, and I can't currently afford
                                            to buy Altium.</p>

                                            <em>mechanical</em> in here, eh? About a year ago myself and two friends
                                            made the somewhat irrational decision to purchase a 1986 (not sure on the
                                            exact year) Hobie Cat 17' Catamaran off of Craigslist.

                                        <p>
                                            This boat has a lot wrong with it. A lot of the fiberglass is delaminating
                                            (I learned what that means <em>after</em> receiving this boat), there are a
                                            good ammount of cracks and dings, and the sail is on its last legs.

                                            So we got to work. Here's my Dad with his classic "well just what the hell
                                            are we gonna do with this" pose as we deconstruct the Hobie into its
                                            individual pieces. A number of issues presented themselves during this
                                            process, such as a pocket of water suspiciously close to a large crack that
                                            would not empty out of the rear drain plug. As it turns out, there are two
                                            reasons why this was happening.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            One: there are a couple "flotation blocks"
                                            within the hull which ensure that the boat will float in any event where the
                                            hulls fill completely with water. These flotation blocks are wrapped in a
                                            plastic laminate during the main hull curing process to protect them from
                                            damaging fumes. These plastic bags are strong, so its okay to just leave
                                            them in the hull, however over 25 years they begin to disintegrate and the
                                            debris start plugging the drain holes in between each hull section.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Two: we discovered that some of the water was actually stuck in one of the
                                            "wing
                                            tube" compartments. The wing tubes are where you insert the gull-wing mesh
                                            seats prior to sailing, and while the tubes themselves end about halfway
                                            into the hull, the compartment that holds them extends to the opposite end
                                            of the hull and has no drainage. This means that if there's a leak between
                                            the wing tube and compartment it can be very difficult to get that water
                                            back out again. Water sitting in the hull of a boat can lead to much more
                                            rapid delamination of the fiberglass, so this is a potentially devastating
                                            issue despite the volume of water that can fit in this compartment being
                                            small.

                                            First things first, fix the surface dings. The most important of which being
                                            that big crack propagated all the way through the hull. Quite a bit of water
                                            made its way in
                                            through it that didn't end up going into the wing-tube, and just sat soaking
                                            into this crack over multiple months. This caused the fiberglass around the
                                            crack to lose a lot of structural integrity. We ended up having to drill out
                                            a lot of material around the crack after sanding down the paint, which is
                                            what you can see in the following picture.

                                            Here you can see the full fiberglass repair prior to re-painting with
                                            gel-coat. My cousin and I each spent maybe 3 hours watching tutorial videos
                                            in order to determine all of the best practices in terms of epoxy resins and
                                            additives necessary for all of the various repairs around the boat. The hull
                                            of the Hobie Cat 17' is remarkably thin. So thin that I couldn't count more
                                            than 3 layers of fiberglass as I sanded and drilled around this crack.

                                            Here, finally, is the (almost) finished product. There's still some
                                            high-grit wet sanding to be done here to get it looking nice, but the crack
                                            is now officially structurally sound. All that's left for us to do now is
                                            work out how to drain and re-buff the wing tube. The plan as of now is to
                                            install a 6-8" hull port on the cieling of the hull near the wing tube in
                                            order to reach in and do the repair. The repair itself will involve drilling
                                            out any damaged material and re-wrapping the tube in fiberglass.
