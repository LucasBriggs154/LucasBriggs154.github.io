                            Hello! My name is Lucas Briggs (first name Timothy). I am currently lacking a recent formal headshot
                            so please enjoy this picture of myself sleeping 500 feet in the air on a "port-a-ledge". I am
                            a practiced young engineer graduating from Northeastern University in May 2022. I have nearly
                            two years of engineering work experience through a variety of co-ops and other internships from
                            throughout my time in college. These experiences have largely centered around aerospace and satellite
                            development specifically. The work itself has consisted of electronic hardware development
                            and board design as well as a great deal of test automation and software design. I have done my best
                            to avoid pigeon-holing myself into a particular engineering skill as I value generalism and flexibility
                            and would eventually like to lead projects that draw on many different skillsets and disciplines.

                            I have been infatuated with space and technology for as long as I can remember. I also care deeply
                            about helping to improve the lives of as many people as possible here on Earth. I have been fortunate
                            enough to work on projects like Arcturus at Astranis and Starlink at SpaceX that aim to close the
                            internet gap worldwide with small satellites. Another mission that I hope to contribute to at some
                            point is the fight for the climate and the environment, as I believe that to be a serious existential
                            threat to all of us.

                                            Over the Summer of 2021, I participated in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
                                            program offered by the MIT Haystack Observatory. The experience lasted about 3 months. I was
                                            working on a project known as "AERO-VISTA", where a pair of CubeSat spacecraft are being designed
                                            and built to collect spectrum measurements of auroral emissions in low-earth orbit. The satellites
                                            employ a novel "vector sensor" technology that allows for determination of direction and magnitude
                                            of an incident electro-magnetic wave at a single point in Space.

                                            My portion of this project focused specifically on the software responsible for communications
                                            between the satellites and the ground stations that will be sending commands and receiving data.
                                            The fundamental concept was to create a software package that would enable a packet of data to
                                            be queued for transmission remotely and asynchronously, and then transmitted reliably.

                                            I ended up presenting this project as a poster at the New England SDR (NEWSDR) conference of 2021.
                                            The recording of the livestream for that event is embedded below and set to the timestamp where I
                                            gave a 3-minute introduction of myself and my work. A .pdf file of the poster itself is included
                                            below the video as well. These do a great job of explaining my project in detail.

                                            Over the course of implementing this ground station interface software, it became apparent that
                                            it could be extended to apply as a generic interface for many small satellite projects as long
                                            as custom configuration was properly implemented. There is a surprising lack of general, open-source
                                            solutions available for small satellites since the capability to launch a research CubeSat for
                                            relatively cheap is fairly new. The CubeSat Space Protocol and Daniel Estévez's "gr-satellites"
                                            package for GNURadio are a couple of good examples, but a generic data uplink/downlink interface
                                            like this does not really exist at the moment.

                                            I will be returning to Haystack in the Spring of 2022 as a part-time researcher to continue this
                                            project. The hope is to make it even more generic, and potentially usable for any combination of
                                            small satellite and ground station radio interfaces. This provides an exciting opportunity for me
                                            to take this project that I developed from the ground-up and make a real contribution to the
                                            small satellite community.

                                            In the Spring of 2021, I had the opportunity to work at SpaceX on the Starlink
                                            project. This was the perfect continuation on the small internet satellite
                                            experience I had from my co-op with Astranis. There I met a ton of very smart
                                            people and got to participate in the fast-paced and exciting culture that SpaceX
                                            is well known for. My projects centered largely around test automation software,
                                            as a proper continuation of the work I did toward the end of my time at Astranis.

                                            reasons. To the right is a picture of me at the beautiful Baker Lake in Washington on
                                            a road trip that myself and several of the other interns at SpaceX took
                                            toward the end of our time there.

                                            For Starlink I worked on the RF Test team focused on automating the verification and
                                            characterization of all the custom integrated circuits designed for the Starlink satellites
                                            and their complicated phased array antenna technology. My project centered mainly around
                                            the C# library being used to debug chips and run automated tests. My boss, Matt Valerio, had
                                            a clear vision of a robust and cohesive libary of test instrument drivers, chip control, test
                                            control, and user interfaces that would make any test automation task easy to implement. The
                                            library, however, was just moving from version "1" to version "2", and so many of these concepts
                                            were in their infancy.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I began by implementing a driver for a bench power-supply unit (PSU). "Driver", in this case, refers
                                            to a software object that abstracts instrument features to a set of functions in C# that can be called
                                            during an active test to execute those operations. For a PSU, these functions are quite simple. Each
                                            power supply "rail" has a set voltage, set current-limit, and is set to be "on" or "off". Underlying
                                            these drivers are the concepts of the connection being established to the instrument (usually over
                                            Ethernet) and some handler for the commands to send over that connection (most instruments use the
                                            SCPI protocol). The goal was implement all of this while paying particular mind to the SOLID
                                            principles of Object-Oriented Programming such that future changes could be implemented as
                                            <em>extensions</em> of already-implemented objects instead of <em>replacements</em> of them.

                                            I then implemented drivers for an RF power sensor, a vector signal generator (VSG), and a vector
                                            spectrum analyzer (VSA), each more complicated than the last. Eventually I had enough instruments
                                            implemented such that I could write an actual test. The test I designed collected Adjacent-Channel
                                            Leakage Ratio (ACLR) and Inter-Modulation Distortion (IMD) measurements from some RF power amplifier
                                            that acted as the device-under-test (DUT). This test was also run with a new test operation GUI that
                                            I helped to design which enabled individual test tasks to be run in sequence with pauses in between
                                            for the test operator to manually change the testing conditions according to a guide (like changing
                                            connections). The goal of this GUI was to make it simple enough to run tests that someone with no
                                            experience in C# would be able to do so.

                                            In the Spring of 2020, I moved out to San Fransisco to work for a small internet
                                            satellite startup known as Astranis. This was a great experience for me.

                                            Unfortunately I can't show off any pictures of my main project, as that
                                            would
                                            not abide by ITAR restrictions. In this next picture is something that we
                                            called
                                            the "Power Harness Board". It is an extremely simple board that harnesses
                                            between two important power boards for lab-bench flexibility. I managed to
                                            design, build, and order this board in a single day, so perhaps it can help
                                            indicate my proficiency with Altium. If nothing else, it is definitely a
                                            showcase of my silk-art abilities.

                                            My main project arched over the majority of my co-op. It was effectively a
                                            board
                                            that would spoof the payload SDR (the one that does all the magic internet
                                            stuff) so we could test the voltage regulator system with something more
                                            robust
                                            and less expensive than the SDR. We called it the "Load Emulator" as its
                                            main
                                            purpose was to <em>emulate</em> realistic behavior for the <em>load</em> on
                                            each
                                            of the more than 15 different voltage rails that would supply the SDR.

                                            The board I made was good. It worked the first time, only needed a couple
                                            minor
                                            reworks to be fully functional, and got the regulator board through bring-up
                                            on
                                            schedule. However, I think where I really left my mark was with the Python
                                            scripts and Grafana visualizations that I wrote to operate the regulator
                                            board.
                                            Again, I wish I could show those visualizations, but ITAR says no.
                                            Basically, I
                                            was able to build an interactive shell that could perform operations on any
                                            board in the SDR box while gathering telemetry from all of them at once, in
                                            a
                                            background thread. While I was at the company these tools enabled the RTL
                                            team
                                            to burn down issues with their Verilog scripts quickly and effectively.
                                            Since
                                            I've left the company they've helped my team bring the entire SDR box
                                            through
                                            full qualification testing.

                                            I can actually talk about the main circuit on this "Load Emulator" test
                                            platform, as I was able to find a near-replica of it in a TI analog design
                                            article (full article <a
                                                href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa868/slaa868.pdf?ts=1600202605217&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F"
                                                target="_blank">here</a>). We called our version of this an "active
                                            load" circuit, TI calls it a "programmable low side current sink". The point
                                            of this circuit is to have an isolated DAC input set the current drawn on
                                            some supply voltage by varying the voltage over R<sub>SET</sub> (the DAC
                                            output is replicated over R<sub>SET</sub> due to the summing point
                                            constraint of A1). C<sub>F</sub> is a fast-path capacitor that filters out
                                            ringing due to FET gate delay. What's so crucial about this circuit is that
                                            it's a simple design change to optimize it for different maximum current
                                            values. By simply varying the value of R<sub>LOAD</sub>, and adding load
                                            resistors/FETs in parallel, one can easily increase the available current
                                            capacity while staying within de-rating on each component.

                                            I went to Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Cambridge, MA for my first
                                            work experience through the Northeastern co-op program. This was from January
                                            to June of 2019. Due to ITAR restrictions, I don't have any pictures of things
                                            that I worked on. I do, however, have this picture of me blowing up a sterile
                                            glove at my desk.

                                            Draper was, for me, a very solid first co-op experience. I entered it with
                                            pretty much zero practical knowledge of electrical engineering aside from
                                            what I learned in robotics in high school. In fact, a lot of my intuition
                                            for electronics ended up coming from the fellow co-op on my team, Joshua
                                            Berlin, who was a year ahead of me and very talented at both electrical
                                            engineering and the teaching of it.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            While I was there I learned how to draft a schematic and layout for a simple
                                            board consisting of 7 bi-directional level translators and a custom 8-input
                                            OR-gate (using BJTs). This was my first time going through a full stack
                                            board design process, and I got quite good at the program I was using.
                                            I also had a <em>lot</em> of re-work
                                            to do on this board due to miscommunication between me and my team. Josh saw
                                            me through the process of learning how to actually solder properly so I
                                            could fix the boards as fast as possible.

                                            I also learned a lot about coding and test automation. One project entailed
                                            building a program in Python, Arduino, and GNURadio to operate a servo
                                            platform via both a PyQT GUI and signals coming from 4 different SDRs. These
                                            SDRs were connected to 4 high-directivity antennae arranged in a NSEW
                                            pattern, and the idea was to track an object based on radar signal received
                                            on those antennae. Another project involving Arduino had me design a program
                                            to test the capability of a <a
                                                href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si5338.pdf"
                                                target="_blank">Si5338</a> clock generator chip to sweep it's output
                                            frequency at different accuracies over a large range. This project occured
                                            near the end of my co-op so I then had to write a 17-page guide detailing
                                            how I accomplished this particular sweeping strategy so that the FPGA
                                            engineer on the project would be able to replicate it in HDL.

                                            Draper taught me a lot about how to work effectively on a co-op, and about
                                            what that work meant to me. Management was often quite busy and work was
                                            sporadic. So I really had to learn how to go around and ask others for both
                                            stuff to do and help with the stuff I was actively doing. Since then I have
                                            never been shy of asking others to help me when I truly need it, and
                                            consider my self an active and social member of any office. I worked on a
                                            total of 9 different projects, some took up more time than others, but this
                                            was really the ideal way to begin thinking about what application of
                                            electrical engineering I enjoy the most (something I am admittedly still
                                            figuring out). Although, this level of project spread is not something I
                                            would repeat as I often felt spread thin. Draper was also very
                                            "need-to-know" on project impact, so I remain unsure as to whether any of
                                            the work I did could be used on some weapons platform. That idea did and
                                            still does make me uncomfortable, so I've made a point to understand the
                                            full impact and big picture of everything that I work on since then.
                                            Overall, Draper was the right mix of good and not-so-good for me to figure
                                            out what I wanted to do next and set me on a path that I am so far very
                                            happy with.

                                            Over the summer of 2020, I worked on a project with the RSS
                                            Fingerprinting team of NEU-SPIRAL, a data-oriented research lab an
                                            Northeastern. The project was focused around indoor
                                            navigation by Wi-Fi received-signal-strength.
                                            What you can see in this first picture is a bunch of Wi-Fi RSS
                                            data collected from a real-world study and displayed as a room using Python
                                            matplotlib. This room was in a library, and the white spaces you can see in
                                            the image are the bookshelves in that room. In total there were 448
                                            different Wi-Fi access points detected over the course of the study, and the
                                            software tools that I wrote allow you to look at the data for any set of
                                            those access points over any collection of epochs within the study.
                                        </p>

                                            A key feature of this RSS simulator is the ability to generate a
                                            momentum-influenced random-walk trajectory through the room's valid
                                            positions. This trajectory can be seen in red within the following picture.
                                            There is then the option of "tracking" this trajectory using the available
                                            RSS data and a cubature Kalman filter. The minimized-error trajectory
                                            determined by this tracking algorithm can be seen in blue. Neither the
                                            random walk nor the tracking algorithms were designed directly by me, but I
                                            did have to gain a basic understanding of both in order to implement them
                                            into the simulator.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div style="align-self: center;">

                                            Another key feature of this tool is the ability to vary the "noise" and
                                            "uncertainty" of the RSS measurements by dragging the "n" and "u" sliders at
                                            the bottom of the plot (the ap slider is to view the RSS data for individual
                                            access points. In this case we are looking at access point 1). In this next
                                            picture you can see noisier RSS data and the resulting noisier trajectory
                                            estimation.

                                            Raising the "uncertainty" slider makes it more likely that an access point
                                            is not detected in a given measurement (based on the probability of that
                                            access point being detected over the study epochs being analyzed). An access
                                            point not being found at a certain position is represented by a whole lot of
                                            white nothing at that position.

                                            Oddly enough, the estimation in the more uncertain example is better than
                                            previously when it was just noisy. This is due to the fact that in order to
                                            update each position RSS based on these new uncertainty values we will also
                                            end up reshuffling the noise. This may or may not be an issue, and is an
                                            example of changes I may need to make going forward.

                                            The Spindle Rock Club LLC sailing program was my childhood, my first full-time
                                            summer job, and something I hold near and dear to my heart.

                                        <p>
                                            I sailed with the program as a student every summer for 4 years. A day from
                                            one of those years is represented in the following photo which, fun fact,
                                            actually made it into the local newspaper. The program sails along
                                            a tidal river with a ripping current and access to the open
                                            ocean. It is super fun, occasionally dangerous, and I consider myself very
                                            lucky to have had the opportunity to experience it for so many years.

                                            I taught for 5 years, the last year of which I was given the job of "Head
                                            Instructor". That year there was also a new director by the name of John Bergland.
                                            John and I worked to modernize, restructure, and redefine the
                                            sailing program as something that took the act of instructing more seriously
                                            than in years past. I found that putting in the necessary effort to help a
                                            kid be confident in a sailboat from the get-go was much more rewarding than
                                            being a glorified babysitter. I sort of manifested a curriculum by simply
                                            messing around with different ideas for drills on the water and keeping
                                            what worked. John, myself, and the other instructors worked hard to ensure
                                            that the program could be flexible to the needs of parents. We managed a
                                            dynamic schedule where classes and students could be added on a daily,
                                            sometimes hourly, basis.

                                            The program that year and years following saw great
                                            feedback from parents and students, and there were some numbers to show for
                                            it. Based on figures that I generated for the board of directors that year,
                                            our total revenue and student enrollment both increased about 70% over the
                                            previous year. The instructors I taught with during this time were and are
                                            some of my closest friends. This is one of my favorite pictures I ever took.
                                            It's of my good friend Charles giving a demonstration on proper
                                            dry-capsizing technique, and I believe it encompasses what we were all
                                            about.

                                            Since this is the first website I've ever designed. I decided to work in
                                            pure HTML and CSS (and a very small amount of JS). I never took an HTML or
                                            webdev course in high school or college, so I figured this would be a good
                                            opportunity to learn the basics behind every webpage on the internet. I spent
                                            a solid 6 hours watching Traversy Media videos on YouTube and reading through
                                            documentation to produce the structure of this website, which uses the Bootstrap
                                            library to make everything look modern. I also managed to utilize CSS Flexbox and
                                            Grid properly to make everything fairly responsive. Most of the content on this
                                            site should look decent on a variety of screen sizes.

                                            In order to accomplish all this I spent a good 6 hours watching Traversy
                                            Media videos on YouTube and reading through various documentation on HTML,
                                            CSS, Flexbox, Grid, and Bootstrap. Actually, oddly enough, I did have some
                                            experience in React Native going in. My roommate and I got about halfway
                                            through designing an app before a company known as Atleto managed to release
                                            something remarkably similar. During that project, however, I spent much
                                            more time with the data transfer than the UI design. That same roommate,
                                            Danny McGrath, got really good at webdev and was a huge help in directing me
                                            to the right resources while I was building this website.

                                            I also contracted my roommate John Byrne, who has recently been spending a lot of
                                            time having fun in Photoshop, to craft me a little logo with my initials.
                                            Using circuit components was all his idea, and I think it turned out really
                                            well! To check out his website and other friends' websites, check out the

                                            While I was quarantined in San Francisco due to COVID-19, my roommates and I
                                            participated in a remote hackathon called Hacktech 2020. It was
                                            disappointing not being able to go down to LA and get the full experience,
                                            but we had fun with it nonetheless. The full project can be found <a

                                            The Devpost has way more information than I'm going to provide here, but
                                            I'll reiterate a few things. First of all, we won! Well, we got 3rd place in
                                            the "eBay API" category. But that's still enough to get us the title of
                                            "Winner", and there were quite a few projects in that category since the 1st
                                            place prize was an Apple Watch. Being able to say I won my first hack-a-thon
                                            is pretty sweet. This was also my first full software project that I saw
                                            through from start to finish, and gave me a lot of experience in Python. My
                                            job throughout the project was to build a series of web-scrapers that would
                                            go to online storefronts like Amazon or Wal-Mart and gather data on what
                                            products would show up when you search certain keywords. I would scrape the
                                            page for product names and prices and then compile the data into the top 10
                                            words by frequency-of-use and an average price point. It turned out to be
                                            pretty accurate, and the resulting nonsensical jumble of keywords worked
                                            very well as a product description for eBay's search algorithm.

                                            Altogether this project was a great success, and I'm grateful especially to
                                            my roommate at the time, Nikhil Bhat, who had a lot more Python experience
                                            at the time and helped me a lot when I would get stuck.

                                            idea here is to build a circuit to both process an audio signal and control
                                            a set of programmable RGB LEDs (WS2815). My initial implementation employed
                                            the strategy of using a single-supply op-amp to DC-bias the input audio
                                            signal so that it could be received directly at the ADC of a Teensy
                                            microcontroller. The pdfs of the schematic and layout (made in Eagle) for
                                            this design can be seen below.</p>
                                        <p>The digital circuitry involved here (basically just a microcontroller and a
                                            level translator) worked like a dream, as you can see in this gif. However
                                            the analog circuit was a different story.</p>

                                            In the next picture you can see my initial implementation of this on a
                                            soldered protoboard, which ended up being a mistake. Since my desire to do
                                            this resulted in me having to limit myself to thru-hole components, and a
                                            random solder bridge led to me shorting and frying my Teensy, this ended up
                                            being much more expensive than just ordering the PCB. After taking a break
                                            from this project and coming back, I realized that I've probably been going
                                            about it the wrong way.

                                            Inducing a DC bias on the audio signal makes the complexity of this circuit
                                            much more difficult to implement. Also, after simming the circuit in LTSpice
                                            I found that it introduced some delay to amplitude changes in the output.
                                            This is not ideal for a circuit that needs to respond to changes in an audio
                                            signal as fast as possible.

                                        <p>I will be the first to admit, this project has given me some trouble.
                                            Going forward I am going to address these problems in the circuit either by
                                            re-implementing the DC biasing circuit or by scrapping it and using an
                                            external high-speed ADC that can detect positive and negative voltages. All
                                            I would need then is a standard input buffer and standard audio ADC. I am
                                            also going to move this design over to KiCAD, as I believe it has become a
                                            superior design tool to Eagle in a lot of ways, and I can't currently afford
                                            to buy Altium.</p>

                                            A few years ago myself and a couple of my closest friends
                                            made the somewhat irrational decision to purchase a 1986 (not sure on the
                                            exact year) Hobie Cat 17' Catamaran off of Craigslist. We put it on the water
                                            soon after trailering it back from the seller (the picture on the right is from
                                            that day). On that maiden voyage we discovered that one of the hulls had a fairly
                                            significant leak.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Close inspection revealed a large crack in the hull that took on water. This
                                            damage probably occurred while we were trailering the boat. There were also a good
                                            number of other minor cracks and dings, equipment that needed to be replaced, an aging
                                            sail, and overall just a lot that was worth fixing.

                                            individual pieces. A number of issues presented themselves during this
                                            process, such as a pocket of water suspiciously close to a large crack that
                                            would not empty out of the rear drain plug. As it turns out, there are two
                                            reasons why this was happening.

                                            One: There are a couple "flotation blocks"
                                            within the hull which ensure that the boat will float in any event where the
                                            hulls fill completely with water. These flotation blocks are wrapped in a
                                            plastic laminate during the main hull curing process to protect them from
                                            damaging fumes. These plastic bags are strong, so its okay to just leave
                                            them in the hull, however over 25 years they begin to disintegrate and the
                                            debris start plugging the drain holes in between each hull section.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Two: We discovered that some of the water was actually stuck in one of the
                                            "wing
                                            tube" compartments. The wing tubes are where you insert the gull-wing mesh
                                            seats prior to sailing, and while the tubes themselves end about halfway
                                            into the hull, the compartment that holds them extends to the opposite end
                                            of the hull and has no drainage. This means that if there's a leak between
                                            the wing tube and compartment it can be very difficult to get that water
                                            back out again.

                                            Draining and repairing the wing tube is an arduous process that involves
                                            sawing out a hole in the top section of the hull and installing an inspection-hatch.
                                            Opening the inspection hatch provides decent access to the wing tube which can
                                            then be refurbished. We have not begun this process yet, and instead opted to start by
                                            draining the hulls and repairing the major cracks and minor dings.

                                            The most interesting of these repairs is pictured to the right. This hole was carved out
                                            around the crack to get rid of the waterlogged fiberglass. The area around it was then sanded
                                            down through the majority of the fiberglass layers (of which there weren't many) to yield
                                            purchase for the patch job.

                                            Here you can see the full fiberglass patch prior to re-painting with
                                            gel-coat. My cousin and I each spent maybe 3 hours watching tutorial videos
                                            in order to determine all of the best practices in terms of epoxy resins and
                                            additives necessary for all of the various repairs around the boat. For this
                                            particular repair, a small section of fiberglass was cut out in the shape of
                                            the hole we made. That small section was painted onto a larger patch of fiberglass
                                            with epoxy to make a kind of fiberglass "plug". The sides of the opening were coated
                                            in epoxy before inserting the plug which was then painted over with more epoxy. An
                                            additional layer of fiberglass was then epoxied on top, roughly the size of the sanded
                                            area.

                                            Here, finally, is the (almost) finished product. There's still some
                                            high-grit wet sanding to be done here to get it looking nice, but the crack
                                            is now officially structurally sound. Due to the remarkable thinness of the hull,
                                            and the lack of boat-repair experience between my cousin and I, it was inevitable
                                            that the result jutted out a bit.

                                            Due to complications from the pandemic and other responsibilities in life, these
                                            repairs took a while to properly research and complete. Roughly two years after
                                            the "maiden voyage" of our Craigslist boat, however, it was finally ready to go on the
                                            water again. Things went a lot better this time; my cousin and I were able to sail around
                                            in high wind without any complications, and the hull didn't take on any water! Since then
                                            all that's changed is a few hardware and rope replacements. The next steps will be to install
                                            that inspection port and repair the wing tubes, but for now the boat is totally functional and
                                            a lot of fun to use.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            All in all, it didn't take much effort to get this boat to the point where people could enjoy it.
                                            Hopefully this continues to be a project that I can return to occasionally during summers,
                                            or maybe one of my nine nieces/nephews will be able to take it over at some point. I think the moral
                                            of the story is that everyone should buy a boat off of Craigslist if provided the opportunity.
